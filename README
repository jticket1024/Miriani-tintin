### Intro and credits:
Hello, and thank you for using the Miriani soundpack for Tintin++ by Jason. This
pack was originally started almost 2 years go, but due to OOC reasons, I had to
stop playing mostly, and also stopped work on this pack. In the time I had to
give up work on this pack, Miriani 1.0 for Tintin was released by another author. I wish to make
it known, that this pack, and Miriani1.0 are not the same, nor is this an
extension of that pack. I also wish to take no credit away from the author of
version 1.0, or the one hosting it, but as it isn't supported anymore, I figured
I would pick up support.

Sounds from this soundpack came from various sources, including a few from older packs,
a friend who worked on one of of the originals for MT or Mush, I can't remember
which now, and also several sound effect libraries.

###Liability and License:
This soundpack is covered by the GPL license, and basically states:
You can copy, modify and redistribute any or all of this pack,as long as you
include either the original or a link to the original, as well as credit to the
original auther ,as well as any previous authers. Saying that, I make no other
warranty, guarantee, and no claims to any liability for the use of this pack,
especially against the claim of losing sleep, friends, relationships, or jobs.

### Contacting the author:
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or anything of the sort, you
can post on the "OOC>Soundpacks" message boards, but I would prefer an email, as
I watch that more. I can be contacted at:

soundpacks@mail.com

As this isn't the only game I am working on soundpacks for please follow the
format below in the subject line:
tintin miriani <bug|comment|request>
with only one of <bug|comment|request> in the line, as well as the rest in the
message body. Please also, include all you can if reporting a bug, including
where it happened, and conditions, and also for a request feature, if it's
replacing text with sounds, please give me the text lines you wish to be replaced
with sounds, or any other requests. 
NOTE:
I absolutely refuse to build you, or help you build any scripts that help bot,
grind, or otherwise make your player advance with little to no interaction. The
rest of us had to grind away manually, puttin work into our characters, so you
must too. I also refuse to put any other triggers into my packs that break
policies. This means things like autolocking, lock and fire triggers, or hotkeys for
shooting, among others. Certain things, like the "sc" for scan alias, or the
secondary keys for movement and such were okay specifically by a host.

### Setup and use:
This pack as mentioned above is for the Tintin++ client. I wrote most of this
using Ubuntu, and then arch, so I know they work on that. It should also work on
the Macintosh command line, but installation of everything for that is beyond
this README. Tintin++ is either available in most distriutions' repos, or as
in the case of Archlinux, the AUR IArch User Reposityry). Packages you'll need:
Tintin++
Sox with wavpack support

### Running the pack:
1. If you're reading this, you obtained the pack, either as a direct download
from the GitHub website, or using "git clone." 
2. In the main folder called "miriani" type "tt++ miriani.tin" without the
quotes.
3. That should load everything, and you are brought to your login name, after
the mesages that Tintin spit out.

Again, this should be able to be run on Macintosh, but you would have to
read/google how to install tintin and sox yourself. This should also be able to
be used on any *nix system where you can install/compile Tintin++ and Sox,
including Linux, BSD, and Solaris.

### Soundpack Contents:
The folder contains 3 subfolders:
backups - Where a backup of an unmodified "data.tin" and "miriani.tin" file
reside.
logs - where your logs go when you start to log, in the format of
Year-month-day.txt.
sounds - where *all* the packs sounds live. This is where you can swap/replace
sounds if you so wish.
There are at this time, also 4 files there. 
data.tin - the game's stored data from session to session such as volume and
other variables.
miriani.tin - the main data file for the game written by me.
README - this file
user.tin - a file saved for any user specific work they wish to add. This file
will never be updated by me.

### Updating the pack:
At this time, there are only 2 ways to update. A message will be posted on the
"OOC>soundpacks" board announcing any update, until I write in an autoupdater.
The first way is to go directly to the GitCore site and download the pack again
in a zipped format, and follow the instructions you previously used. The second,
is while in the miriani folder you run the pack from, use the command:
git pull
and that will pull any updates, automatically adding files and replacing old
ones with newer ones if needed.
Note:
If you wish to add your own custom triggers and such, please use the file
"user.tin" as I will not be updating that, so it should never be overwritten. I
would also suggest putting a copy of user.tin in the backups foer as well each
time you modify it, deleting the previous version.

Remeber, this soundpack is a work in progress, and this release is not a final
product of any tipe. I work on this in my spare time, when I can, and will push
updates if bugs are reported, or requests made, at early as possible. I can't
promise updates and such will be available instantly. Thank you for
understanding.

### Command help:
There are a few commands, be they aliases, macros, or hot key combinations I have
included, and will put in more at a later point as well as work progresses. I
will also be adding a file that can be called up in game, for soundpack help
detailing the same, at a later point.

## Function keys:
There is a list of commands associated with the Function keys (F1 to F12). They
are as follows currently:
F1 - Toggles secondary movement mode between walk and fly (explained more
later). Default is in walk.
F2 - Combat Focus: 
Toggles between on or off. When on you will see the coords
followed by the ship when you type focus instead of ship then coords.
F3 - Combat Scanning:
Togles between on and off. When on, all you see during a scan is the ship,
followed by the coords underneath. Use the following keys to access all other
information:
#Macros - Keys used together:
control + h - hull damage
control + k _component damage
control + o - occupants
control + u - distance
#aliases - type, then hit enter:
ses -show enemy ship, ship name, and alliance
swe - weapon state
spo - powere state
sca - cargo
F4 - Logging:
Toggles logging on and off. Logs stored in logs subfolder of directory in the
format of "year-month-day.txt."
F9 - Volume status:
Shows the current volume. Shows in the format of 0.x signifying a percentage.
Example 0.20 would be at 20 percent volume. You can go above 1.0 (100 percent)
but I wouldn't advise it. I also wouldn't advise goign or trying to go below
0.0 (0 percent), as that might break something on your system, and I am not responsible for
that.
F10 - Mute/unmute:
Toggles soundpack state - muted or unmuted. Simple enough.
F11 - Volume down:
Lowers the volume by 0.05, or 5 percent. Again, I am not responsible if you
attempt to lower it below 0.0 or 0 percent.
F12 - Volume up:
Raises the volume by 0.05, or 5 percent. Again, I am not responsible if you
raise it above 100 percent.

F5 to F8 will eventually be used for background sound control. I plan on
eventually background looping most,if not the entire game. F9 may aso be changed
at a later point, as calling your volume isn't all that importan, and can be
aliased instead, saving macro keys for more important use.

## Secondary keys - Walking and flying:
As stated above, the F1 key toggles movement mode for secondary keys. When you
press F1, it will change the mode, as well as tell you which mode you are now
in. To use the keys, press Alt and the key specified. 

Key - flight - walking
 U    7         northwest
 I    8         north
 O    9         northeast
 J    4         west
 K    5         Out
 L    6         east
 M    1         southwest
 ,    2         south
 .    3         southeast
 P    +         up
 ;    -         down

You do not need to try to capitalize it. The lower case is what actually works.
So for example, when walking, if you want to head down then southwest, it would
be:
Alt ;, Alt m
and for flying to fly east, then upwards and north (op north up in the same time
as well:
Alt l, Alt p, Alt i

## Other functions:
There are a few other functions to explain hereas well.
Control + q - quit and save:
Puts your char to sleep, saves all your current variables, and exits Tintin++
completely, putting you back in the command prompt for your system.
Control + T - Terminal or console mode:
Toggles your soundpack to use terminal mode, or console mode. It will state
which you are in when you log in, as well as when you use this toggle. The
reasoning is this: soundpacks seem to work differently in Linux, dependant on if
you run them in the terminal (the desktop's command line) or in a console (full command
line, no desktop). When in console mode, the pack puts a split in, so your
typing doesn't get jumbled in with the incoming text, and when put into terminal
mode, it unsplits your panes (sorry no way around this), as otherwiseit doesn't
read right, and also puts a space before the first character of *every* line, so
you don't get chopped words. The only badnote on this, is thatat times, when in
the console, you might have to hit the key to toggle it out of console mode,
into terminal mode, then again back to console mode (Control + t twice) or it repeats in the console as well. Sorry all,
I'm working on this.
Alt + 1 - pa repeat:
Repeats the last message over the PA. I'm working on making it work for the last
10 messages. Also going to add in the same command set, probably control +
numbers, for recalling the last say messages. Good when you're shopping, and
someone talks to you.
